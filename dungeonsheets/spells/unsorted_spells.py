class ControlWater(Spell):
    """Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you 
    choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the 
    following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can 
    repeat the same effect or choose a different one.
    
    Flood: You cause the water 
    level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the 
    area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you 
    choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave 
    that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any 
    Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other 
    side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance 
    of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you 
    choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on 
    the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.
    
    Part Water: You cause
     water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across 
    the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The 
    trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water 
    then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the 
    normal water level is restored.
    
    Redirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the 
    area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over 
    obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area 
    moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes 
    its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the 
    direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.
    
    
    Whirlpool: This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 
    feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The 
    whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at 
    the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 
    feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from 
    the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. 
    When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its 
    turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
     takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. 
    On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the 
    vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away 
    from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength 
    (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the 
    vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, this damage occurs each round 
    it remains in the vortex.

    general course of action, such as Attack that creature, Run over there, or Fetch
     that object. If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further 
    direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
